### NetBackup API Code Samples

Contains code samples of using NetBackup REST APIs in different scripting/programming languages.

##### Disclaimer
These samples are only meant to be used as a reference. Please do not use these in production.

##### Executing the 'snippets'

The `snippets` folder contains code samples to invoke NetBackup APIs using different scripting/programming languages. 
These are usually simple examples that demonstrate specific API. 

Pre-requisites:

- NetBackup 8.1.1 or higher
- See the script's README for the corresponding requirements and usage


##### Executing the 'recipes'

The `recipes` folder contains code samples to invoke NetBackup APIs using different scripting/programming languages. 
These are usually examples of usage of multiple APIs covering specific use-cases.

Pre-requisites:

- NetBackup 8.1.2 or higher
- See the script's README for the corresponding requirements and usage



##### Tools
The `tools` folder contains utilities that have proven useful in the development of projects using NetBackup APIs, but do not provide any API usage examples.  Again, these tools are not for production use, but they may be of some use in your work.
